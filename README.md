**LINK SHORTNER**

In this project, I developed a URL shortener service using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The purpose of this service is to generate short URLs similar to Bitly. Here's a breakdown of the technologies and skills utilized:

Node.js: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side, making it perfect for building web applications.

Express.js: Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js. It provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications, including routing, middleware support, and templating engines.

MongoDB: MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It's schema-less, which means you can store data without a predefined schema, making it suitable for projects where the data structure may evolve over time.

JavaScript: JavaScript is a programming language commonly used for web development. In this project, JavaScript is used both on the server-side (with Node.js) and client-side (potentially, if there's any front-end component).

API Development: The project involves creating an API to handle URL shortening functionality. This API likely includes endpoints for creating short URLs, redirecting users to the original URLs, and potentially other features like analytics or managing shortened URLs.

Asynchronous Programming: Node.js is heavily based on asynchronous programming, using callbacks, promises, or async/await syntax. Asynchronous programming is crucial for handling I/O operations efficiently, such as database queries or HTTP requests.

Middleware: Express.js middleware is used to handle various tasks such as request parsing, logging, authentication, etc. Middleware functions can be chained together to process incoming requests before they reach the route handlers.

Overall, this project demonstrates proficiency in backend web development using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, along with knowledge of RESTful API design principles and best practices.
